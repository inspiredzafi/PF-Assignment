What's special in the Project? 

Well, There are a couple of things.

1. It doesn't uses the switch structure to manually call the functions against the problem statements.

This logic is implemented in the first lines of main function.

It utilizes the concept of "reflection" in Java to dynamically call the functions. 

Which is a robust and concize way to handle this logic.

2. It displays the Menu in chunks. First 10, then 11 - 20, and so on. Clears the console each time the page changes or user executes the program. Which makes it more realiable and less messy.
